# Multi-stage build per the RH container-security checklist
# (topics/09-security.md): pinned slim base, non-root runtime user,
# no secrets in the image.

# Pinned by digest (not the mutable `3.12-slim` tag) so the base image is
# reproducible and can't drift underfoot between builds. Resolved via
# `docker buildx imagetools inspect python:3.12-slim` on 2026-08-11
# (tag was 3.12.13-slim-trixie at resolution time).

# (auto-publish-all-exposed-ports) would then publish the wrong port. Use
# an explicit `-p` mapping (or docker-compose.yml's parameterized ports:
# block, which already handles this) instead of relying on `-P`.
