"""Scope registry and enforcement helpers for agent-comms-mcp tools.

Maps each fully-qualified, mount-prefixed tool name to the single agent-jwt
scope required to invoke it. The mapping is the source of truth — every new
tool MUST be added here in the same PR that introduces it, or it will be
unreachable by agent-jwt Bearer callers (fail-closed default in
``ScopeEnforcementMiddleware``).

Caller classification
---------------------
Interactive users (Okta OIDCProxy) bypass scope checks: their tokens carry
an ``iss`` claim that is NOT ``"agent-jwt"`` (the OIDCProxy issues
FastMCP-internal JWTs whose ``iss`` is the server's own URL). All
non-interactive callers must present an ``iss="agent-jwt"`` token and carry
the required scope in the token's ``scopes`` claim.

    subs keeps impersonation payloads out of the ``scope_denial`` metric
