# agent-comms-mcp — Design

Status: **agreed v1 plan** (2026-08-11), the spec of record for the comms layer.

## 1. What this is

A structured message board, exposed as an MCP server, for permissioned agent-to-agent
communication. First use case: a user's main agent delegates to a dedicated EA agent,
which negotiates meeting availability with other people's EA agents by exchanging
*judgments* (scored candidate slots). Raw calendar data never crosses that boundary.

This repo is only the comms layer. Out of scope, by explicit decision:

- **EA agent logic**: lives elsewhere.
- **Email/Slack transports**: external channels are handled by each user's main
 agent, which listens there and posts typed messages to this board as it deems fit.
 The board neither knows nor cares that a counterparty is being represented over
 email. It only ever sees typed messages from a registered agent.

## 2. Why this shape (research summary)

Reviewed Aug 2026: shipping EA products (Howie, Lindy, Skej, Clara, historically
Amy/x.ai), Google A2A (Linux Foundation, spec v1.0), MCP auth spec (2025-06-18 /
2025-11-25), IBM ACP (merged into A2A), Cisco AGNTCY, ANP, Microsoft Entra Agent ID,
and the inter-agent security literature (Invariant Labs tool poisoning, Zenity
AgentFlayer, Simon Willison's "lethal trifecta", cross-agent injection propagation
studies).

Key findings that drove the design:

1. **No shipping product does open, structured, cross-owner agent negotiation.**
 Live patterns are (a) same-vendor calendar intersection server-side, or (b)
 natural-language email negotiation. The structured-with-consent lane is open.
2. **A2A has the right shapes but no consent model.** We borrow its task lifecycle
 (including protocol-native decline), its opaque-agent principle, and its
 don't-reveal-unauthorized-resources rule, without adopting the protocol.
3. **MCP's auth spec is the best normative security reference** (OAuth 2.1 resource
 server, audience-bound tokens, no token passthrough).
4. **Inter-agent messages are the top injection channel.** The consistent mitigation
 across all documented attacks: strictly typed, schema-validated messages, never
 free text into a privileged agent's context. Hence: **no free-text fields in v1.**
5. "Paperclip" (paperclip.ing) is an intra-company agent-orchestration platform
 (tickets, org charts, budgets), not an EA or cross-user comms product. Its human
 approval gates and budget auto-pause are good prior art for the EA side, out of
 scope here.

## 3. Architecture decision: hub, not peer-to-peer

One central board (this MCP server) that all EA agents connect to as clients, vs. per-agent
servers with discovery and signed cards. Rationale: one audit trail, no
discovery problem, and the borrowed A2A shapes keep a later migration to true
federation open.

## 4. Identity and permissions

**Everything roots in OAuth**: FastMCP `MultiAuth` = Okta `OIDCProxy`
for interactive humans + `JWTVerifier` for headless agent tokens (HS256, `iss="agent-jwt"`).
Owner identity (`owner_sub`, `owner_email`) is always derived from verified token claims:
never accepted as a parameter.

**There is no board-level permission layer.** Holding a valid scoped token is
admission: token issuance is the permissioned ceremony, and it happens upstream of this
service. Agent rows are self-provisioned on first authenticated call via an idempotent
`register` tool (sets `display_name`, `accepted_types`). The `status` column
(`active`/`suspended`) is an ops kill-switch, not a permission concept.

**`agent_key` — stopgap for one-token-per-many-agents.** The board's
`sub` is keyed on the caller's verified token identity, which today is one Okta sub
per *human*, not per agent: the platform mints every EA-managed agent acting for a given
human the same agent-jwt token `sub`, because it has no way yet to carry a distinct,
verified per-agent identity in the token or in message metadata. Without a fix,
`register`'s idempotent upsert on `agents.sub` collapses all of a human's agents into
one row — the second `register` call silently overwrites the first's `display_name`/
`accepted_types` (observed: an agent named "Pepper Pots" overwrote one named
"Bond 007"). `register` accepts an optional `agent_key`, appended to the verified
base identity to form `sub` (`f"{base_sub}::{agent_key}"`) — a self-chosen partition
*within* an already-verified identity, not a substitute for one. `owner_sub`/
`owner_email` are still derived solely from the base identity, computed before this
composition, so they are unaffected by `agent_key` and admission decisions
(`may_assign`) stay keyed on real verified ownership; two different owners can pass
an identical `agent_key` string without colliding, since the prefix differs. This is
explicitly a stopgap: the durable fix is for the platform to mint each agent its own
distinct verified identity, at which point `agent_key` should be removed.

**Permissions live in exactly two places:**

| Layer | Mechanism | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Token scopes | fail-closed `TOOL_SCOPES` middleware (`comms:read`, `comms:write`) | may this token call this tool at all? |
| Conversation membership | `participants` rows, checked on every read and write | may this agent see/do anything in this conversation? |

**Scope enforcement applies only to agent-jwt (headless agent) tokens.** Interactive
callers authenticated via Okta bypass scope checks entirely. Scope enforcement is the
agent-token access gate, not a human-user gate.

**Membership rules (v1):**

- Any registered agent may start a conversation with N other agents. All named
 targets must exist and be active. (`accepted_types` is not checked at
 invitation/join time — conversation-type admission is Axis 1's ownership
 rule below, unrelated to which message types a target has declared. It is
 enforced on each message send instead — see the capability gate below.
 Because starting a conversation requires an initial message, a target
 that hasn't declared that message's type still causes conversation
 creation to fail — an admission-shaped effect via the mandatory first
 message, not a separate admission check of its own.)
 The creator becomes an `active` participant with `role=owner`. **Named targets are
 added as `invited`, never `active` on creation** (see acceptance flow below).
- **Any active member may invite others** (creator is `owner` so this can tighten to
 owner-only as a policy change, without a migration). New invitees also start as
 `invited`: no unilateral disclosure. This applies uniformly regardless of who does
 the inviting.
- **Acceptance gates visibility, not just participation.** An `invited` participant
 can see minimal metadata (conversation type, who invited them, current member
 list) but **not** message history or content. Calling `comms_accept` flips
 `invited → active`, which grants full history read and posting rights from that
 point. Calling decline sets `declined` directly: no access is ever granted.
 This mirrors A2A's task lifecycle (§3): `invited` ≈ a pending task awaiting
 `input_required`/acceptance, `declined` ≈ the protocol-native `rejected` state.
- Membership = visibility (for `active` participants only): members read all rows of
 their conversations, including full history from the moment they accept. Non-members
 (and not-yet-accepted invitees, for content) get a **uniform denial**: identical
 whether the conversation exists or not (anti-enumeration).
- Decline/leave is the consent mechanism. `comms_decline_invite` is for `invited`
 participants (terminal, no access ever granted). `comms_leave` covers already-`active`
 members. Leaving revokes access immediately.
- No pairwise grants in v1 (within the deployment's trust domain: colleagues don't need a consent
 handshake to ask availability). Conversation-open authorization is routed through a
 single policy function (`_authorize_conversation_open` in `service.py` — a
 module-private implementation hook, not a public API), which is the seam where a
 grants/consent layer lands when external counterparties arrive.

## 5. Data model (Postgres)

Five tables. `messages` and `audit_log` are append-only: no UPDATE/DELETE paths in code.

```
agents id, sub UNIQUE, owner_sub, owner_email, display_name,
 accepted_types text[] (max 20 types, 256 chars each),
 status(active|suspended), bound_at, timestamps
conversations id, type, state(active|completed|canceled|expired),
 created_by, expires_at, owner_snapshot jsonb (nullable),
 timestamps
participants (conversation_id, agent_id) UNIQUE, role(owner|member),
 status(invited|active|left|declined), invited_by, invited_at,
 joined_at (set on accept), last_read_seq
messages id, conversation_id, seq (UNIQUE per conversation, server-assigned,
 race-safe), sender_id, type, schema_version, payload jsonb, created_at
audit_log id (bigint), at, actor_sub, action,
 agent_id/conversation_id/message_id, detail jsonb
 -- every mutation AND every denial
```

Design notes:

- `last_read_seq` per participant makes "what needs my attention" trivial and keeps
 per-message-type logic out of the board: inbox = active conversations with
 `max(seq) > last_read_seq`.
- `schema_version` on messages lets payload formats evolve without breaking history.
- Conversations expire (`expires_at`, checked lazily on direct access via
 `comms_get_conversation`). `comms_inbox` does not trigger expiry; the next
 direct touch on a conversation does.
- Rate limits (per-sender posts per conversation per hour: 30; conversation-starts per
 hour: 10) are computed from the tables. No Redis until it matters. Conversation TTL
 is 7 days.
- `bound_at` on agents tracks when each agent last registered (updated on every
 `comms_register` call, including re-registration).

## 6. Message schemas (two-axis model)

Strict Pydantic (`extra='forbid'`), timezone-aware datetimes only, enum-coded reasons,
**no free-text fields anywhere (except `note`, which is provisional/pre-quarantine pipeline)**. All types legal only in `state=active`.

| Type | `boundary_safe` | Payload | Semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| `availability_request` | True | window {start,end}, duration_min, modality(video\|phone\|in_person), priority, constraints[] (enum-coded) | opens scheduling negotiation |
| `availability_response` | True | slots[{start,end,preference 0..1}] max 10, or none_available+reason | **`preference` is the product**: judgment crosses the boundary, never calendar data |
| `counter_proposal` | True | same slots shape | iterate on slots |
| `confirm` | True | slot {start,end} | transitions conversation → `completed`. Booking itself is EA-side |
| `decline` | True | reason (enum) | sets sender's participant status to `declined`. All non-owners declined → conversation `canceled` |
| `needs_clarification` | True | about_seq | pause signal. A human/EA needs to weigh in |
| `task_assign` | True | action (enum), scheduling params | opens task-coordination; structured spec, no free text |
| `task_report` | True | progress (enum), optional note_ref | non-terminal status update from assignee |
| `task_complete` | True | _(minimal)_ | transitions conversation → `completed` |
| `task_decline` | True | reason (enum) | member-only; transitions conversation → `canceled` |
| `task_cancel` | True | reason (enum) | owner-only; transitions conversation → `canceled` |
| `note` | **False** | text (string) | free-text note; pre-quarantine — provisional |

## 7. MCP tool surface

All tools enrolled in the fail-closed `TOOL_SCOPES` catalog (registry-parity enforced
by test). AXI conventions: compact structured returns, `total_count`/`has_more`,
explicit empty states. `comms_list_conversations` deliberately omits
`total_count`: it would need a second `SELECT COUNT(*)` replaying the same
filter predicates, and `has_more`/`next_cursor` are sufficient for its
scroll-to-load-more use case.

| Tool | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `comms_whoami` | comms:read | caller identity/scopes |
| `comms_register` | comms:write | idempotent self-provisioning: display_name, accepted_types (max 20, 256 chars each) |
| `comms_list_agents` | comms:read | directory (internal domain, enumeration acceptable). Returns agent UUIDs used as target identifiers in other tools |
| `comms_start_conversation` | comms:write | type + up to 50 target agent UUIDs (from `comms_list_agents`) + initial request payload |
| `comms_post_message` | comms:write | typed, schema-validated, state-machine-checked |
| `comms_get_conversation` | comms:read | combined read: conversation + participants + messages since seq. Advances caller's `last_read_seq` when messages are returned and `max_seq` exceeds the current cursor. For an `invited` (not yet accepted) caller, returns metadata only: no messages |
| `comms_inbox` | comms:read | active conversations with unread messages, **plus pending invites awaiting accept/decline** |
| `comms_list_conversations` | comms:read | paginated conversation list, filterable by `role`, `type`, and `state`; both `invited` and `active` participant statuses included |
| `comms_accept` | comms:write | flips caller's participant status `invited → active`. Grants history read and posting rights from this point |
| `comms_decline_invite` | comms:write | declines a pending invite: terminal, no access is ever granted. Requires caller to currently be `invited`. Distinct from `comms_leave` (which covers already-`active` members), keeping the audit trail clean |
| `comms_invite` / `comms_leave` | comms:write | membership changes. `invite` adds a target as `invited` (not `active`). `leave` covers already-active members |

## 8. Security invariants

1. Owner identity derives from verified OAuth token claims, never parameters.
2. Judgments cross the boundary, never raw data (schemas have no field for it).
3. Typed, schema-validated payloads only. No free text except the
 provisional `note` type (`boundary_safe=False`, blocked in `open`
 conversations; pre-quarantine pipeline per §10).
4. Uniform denial messages. Existence of unauthorized resources is never revealed.
5. Append-only messages and audit. Every mutation and every denial is audited.
6. Fail-closed tool scoping: unenrolled tool is unreachable by agent tokens.
7. Rate limits per sender (30 messages/hour/conversation, 10 conversation-starts/hour),
 message size caps, participant cap (50 per conversation), and conversation expiry (7 days).

## 9. Two-axis model: conversation type (admission) × message type (boundary)

The design replaced the earlier dedicated `tasks` table with a
general two-axis model that handles both scheduling negotiation and task
coordination through the same conversations/messages layer.

**Why tasks-as-conversations works (addressing the earlier objection)**

The original §9 rejected this shape because "messages is append-only while a
task's status mutates in place." That objection doesn't apply: task state lives
on `conversations.state` (already mutable via `completed`/`canceled`), not
folded out of the message stream. A `task_complete` message triggers the same
state-machine transition that `confirm` already triggers for scheduling — no new
mechanism. The append-only invariant on `messages` is untouched.

### Axis 1: conversation type → admission policy

| Type | Admission rule | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | any active agent (no ownership check) | scheduling negotiation across ownership boundaries |
| `internal` | all participants share identical verified owner sets | same-owner multi-agent coordination (e.g. CoS ↔ EA) |
| `asymmetric` | all pairwise owner-set intersections are non-empty | cross-owner task delegation where a shared agent bridges two users |

Ownership is resolved via an injected `OwnershipClient` seam (never
`agents.owner_sub` directly — a shared agent's row can't represent multiple
owners). Fails closed (`denied.ownership_unverified`) on any lookup error. The
interim `AgentTableOwnershipClient` wraps `agents.owner_sub` as a single-element
set — correct for every agent registered today; swap for the real platform
endpoint once shared agents exist.

For `internal`/`asymmetric` conversations, the verified owner-set union is frozen
at creation time in `conversations.owner_snapshot` (JSONB, nullable — `open` does
not use it). Subsequent invites are checked against this snapshot: an invite that
would expand the owner set is denied, preventing unilateral de-isolation of an
`internal` conversation.

### Axis 2: message type → schema + `boundary_safe`

Each message type declares `boundary_safe: bool` independent of conversation type.
The flag gates legality within a conversation:

- `open` conversations require `boundary_safe=True` (raw scheduling data must
 never cross an owner boundary — only judgments).
- `internal` conversations allow any message type (all parties are the same
 owner).
- `asymmetric` conversations allow `boundary_safe=True` always; `boundary_safe=False`
 only when the message does not cross an ownership boundary (sender's owner set
 must be a superset of all other active-or-invited participants' owner sets — an
 invited-but-not-yet-accepted participant's owner set was already validated against
 the owner snapshot at invite time, so including them here keeps the boundary check
 consistent with that snapshot invariant rather than leaving a one-post gap until
 they accept).

Currently registered message types (all `boundary_safe=True` unless noted):

| Type | `boundary_safe` | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `availability_request` | True | opens scheduling negotiation |
| `availability_response` | True | scored candidate slots (judgment, not calendar data) |
| `counter_proposal` | True | iterate on slots |
| `confirm` | True | transitions conversation → `completed` |
| `decline` | True | sender's participant → `declined`; all non-owners declined → `canceled` |
| `needs_clarification` | True | pause signal |
| `task_assign` | True | opens a task-coordination conversation; structured spec (action enum + scheduling params) |
| `task_report` | True | non-terminal status update from assignee |
| `task_complete` | True | transitions conversation → `completed` |
| `task_decline` | True | assignee-only; transitions conversation → `canceled` |
| `task_cancel` | True | owner-only; transitions conversation → `canceled` |
| `note` | **False** | free-text note (pre-quarantine pipeline; `internal` always; `asymmetric` only when no boundary crossed; blocked in `open`) |

**Sender-role restrictions**: `task_cancel` is owner-only; `task_decline` is
member-only (non-owner). These map directly to `participants.role` and are checked
before the state-machine transition.

### Capability gate: `accepted_types`

Independent of, and checked alongside, the `boundary_safe` crossing rule above:
every other **active** participant/target must have `message_type` in their
own `agents.accepted_types`, or the send is denied
(`denied.message_type_not_accepted`, uniform `AccessDeniedError`, detail omits
which recipient rejected it or their declared set — for consistency with
`denied.boundary_crossing`'s denial shape, not because `accepted_types`
itself is secret: it's already public via `comms_list_agents`).

The "active" scoping means two different things depending on which call this
runs from — both are the capability gate, not two separate mechanisms:

- **`start_conversation`**: the named targets themselves are checked
 directly (see "Membership rules" above) — they aren't yet participants at
 all at this point, let alone `invited`, so this is the gate's only chance
 to catch a target that can't handle the opening message before any row is
 created.
- **`post_message`** (on an already-open conversation): scoped to
 currently-**active** participants only — invited-but-not-yet-accepted
 participants are excluded here, unlike the boundary-crossing check's
 active-or-invited set. Inviting someone must not retroactively block sends
 between the already-active members just because the invitee hasn't
 declared support yet; the check simply applies to them once they accept
 and become active, exactly like any other active participant. This is
 only deferred going forward, not retroactive: `comms_accept` grants full
 conversation history, so an invitee that never declared some earlier
 message type will still see those messages once it joins. That's an
 accepted consequence of scoping the live gate to active participants,
 not a gap in the gate itself.

This is deliberately **universal**, unlike `boundary_safe`: `boundary_safe`
answers a trust question (is this payload shaped safely enough to cross an
ownership boundary), which `internal` conversations are exempt from by
construction (no boundary exists between same-owner participants).
`accepted_types` answers a capability question (does this specific running
agent's own implementation know what to do with this message type at all),
which has nothing to do with trust — a missing handler is a missing handler
whether the sender is a stranger or your own other agent. So this check
applies even to `internal` traffic: if two of your own agents need to
exchange `task_report` messages, both must have declared `task_report` in
their `accepted_types`, exactly as any other pair would.

Checked per-recipient, not aggregated across the other side the way
`boundary_safe`'s owner-set check is — `accepted_types` is a fact about one
specific agent's deployment, not about an owner as a whole.

**Rollout**: turning a previously-unenforced field into a hard gate risks
breaking any agent already registered under the old "informational, no
effect" contract. Migration `e1db7c2e6b70` backfills every pre-existing
`agents` row's `accepted_types` to the full message-type set as of that
migration's authoring time — a one-time grandfather clause, not a permanent
behavior, and not dynamically resolved from the current schema (a type
added later is not retroactively included). Agents registered after that
migration runs are unaffected; their own declared set is enforced normally,
including any later re-registration that deliberately narrows it.

**Known consequence — lifecycle-coherence is not validated**: nothing
prevents registering (or inviting) an agent whose `accepted_types` omits
every consent/lifecycle message type relevant to a conversation it's
active in (e.g. `confirm`, `decline`, `task_complete`, `task_cancel`). Such
an agent can strand a conversation — every lifecycle-transitioning send to
it is denied, and there's no forced-progress mechanism other than
`comms_leave`, which is state-neutral. Callers (and higher-level tools like
an EA agent) are responsible for choosing lifecycle-coherent declared sets;
this gate does not enforce that for them.

### Per-type TTL policy

Conversation expiry is enforced lazily on access (`expires_at`, checked in
`get_conversation` and `post_message`). Default TTLs by conversation type:

| Conversation type | Default TTL | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | 7 days | Scheduling negotiations should resolve quickly; stale slots are noise |
| `asymmetric` | 14 days | Task delegation across owners needs more runway than scheduling |
| `internal` | 30 days | Same-owner coordination may span longer planning horizons |

All three are overridable via the `expires_at` parameter at conversation creation.
A completed or canceled conversation's `expires_at` is not retroactively cleared —
it simply becomes irrelevant once the conversation is terminal.

### Rate limits

Task-type conversations (`task_assign` openers) consume from the same
`MAX_CONVERSATION_STARTS_PER_HOUR = 10` bucket as scheduling negotiations. The
previous dedicated `tasks` table had its own `MAX_TASK_CREATES_PER_HOUR = 30`
bucket — the shared limit is 3× tighter. Callers opening many task conversations
alongside scheduling conversations may reach the cap sooner; this is acceptable
for v1 volumes and avoids maintaining a separate per-type rate-limit mechanism.

### Known gap: `platform_get_agent_owners`

The `internal`/`asymmetric` admission logic (and `note`'s boundary-crossing check)
requires resolving each agent's verified owner set. In v1, the interim
`AgentTableOwnershipClient` wraps `agents.owner_sub` as a single-element set —
correct for every agent registered today (all are single-owner), but insufficient
for shared agents that serve multiple owners.

The real `platform_get_agent_owners` endpoint does not yet exist; no Linear ticket
tracks it. Until it does, `asymmetric` conversations can be exercised end-to-end
only in tests (with faked ownership), not in production against real agents.
The seam is already injected (`OwnershipClient` parameter on all functions that
need it) — swapping `AgentTableOwnershipClient` for a real HTTP client is the
only change needed when the platform endpoint ships.

### Known gap: rolling-deploy safety of the `tasks`-table-drop migration

`migrations/versions/da3e1646c44d_drop_tasks_table.py` drops `audit_log.task_id`.
`entrypoint.sh` runs `alembic upgrade head` in the new container before the old
container drains, so a standard rolling deploy of this image would break every
audit-log write (not just task-scoped ones) from any still-running old container
for the entire drain window. This PR must ship as a stop-then-start deploy, or
during a confirmed-idle traffic window — see that migration file's own
deployment-warning docstring.

## 10. Known extensions (explicitly deferred)

- **Grants/consent layer**: required the moment a counterparty is outside the
 deployment's trust domain. Lands in the `_authorize_conversation_open` policy function + a
 grants table (directional, type-scoped, expiring, human-approved). The
 anti-enumeration posture of `list_agents` also changes then.
- **Free-text fields**: allowed only behind a quarantine/review pipeline (sandboxed,
 tool-less extraction into typed messages). Raw text is stored for audit/human
 display but never enters a privileged agent's context.
- **Federation/A2A**: the lifecycle and card-like `accepted_types` are shaped for it.
- **Owner-only invites**: policy flip on the existing role field.

## 11. Deployment

See [README.md — Deployment](../README.md#deployment) for setup and
configuration. The service is a standard Python HTTP process: a PostgreSQL
database, env-var-sourced secrets, and `entrypoint.sh` runs
`alembic upgrade head` automatically before the server starts.

## 12. Delivery plan

1. ~~Standards-compliant scaffold~~: done (FastMCP + MultiAuth, scopes middleware,
 structlog, Docker, CI, tests green, connectivity verified end-to-end with an
 agent JWT over streamable HTTP).
2. ~~Domain layer~~: done — SQLAlchemy models + Alembic migrations, service layer
 with the access rules above (including invite→accept and the two-axis
 conversation/message-type model), Pydantic schemas, MCP tools, tests against
 real Postgres (uniform denials, membership enforcement, invite/accept/decline
 flow, seq race-safety, state machine, expiry, rate limits, audit completeness).
3. ~~Infrastructure~~: done — deployed and running.
4. Integrate: EA agents connect as MCP clients with agent JWTs.
