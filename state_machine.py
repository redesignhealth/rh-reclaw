"""Pure conversation state-machine rules for the comms board (DESIGN.md §6/§4).

Two independent, side-effect-free functions, deliberately typed with only
primitives (no ORM/DB objects) so the (not-yet-built) service layer can
call them without importing models.py:

- ``is_message_legal``: is this message type postable given the
  conversation's *current* state? (All message types are legal only while
  ``conversation.state == 'active'``.)
- ``resulting_conversation_state``: given that a message of this type was
  just legally posted, what new conversation state (if any) does it cause?
  The service layer supplies the one piece of context it alone has —
  whether every non-owner participant is now declined — via
  ``all_non_owners_declined``; this module never sees participant rows.

Neither function talks to the database, raises, or has side effects —
both are trivially unit-testable with plain strings/bools.
