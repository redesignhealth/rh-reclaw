"""JWT identity resolution for agent-comms-mcp.

Threat model:

- Okta OIDC tokens carry identity in ``email`` / ``preferred_username``;
  their ``sub`` is an opaque Okta id.
- agent-jwt Bearer JWTs carry identity in ``sub`` ONLY. The JWT issuer
  CLI accepts arbitrary ``--sub`` strings and arbitrary extra claims, so an
  agent-jwt token's ``email`` claim is untrusted by design. Three
  impersonation variants are closed here:

  1. ``sub`` IS a victim's email (``--sub alice@example.com``) —
     rejected by ``validate_sub_shape`` (no ``@`` allowed).
  2. Non-email ``sub`` + forged ``email`` claim — closed by gating the
     email-claim path on ``iss != "agent-jwt"``.
  3. Whitespace/empty ``sub`` + forged ``email`` claim — rejected by
     ``validate_sub_shape``.
