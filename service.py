"""Comms domain service layer — all access rules live here, not in tools.

Every function in this module takes an ``AsyncSession`` plus primitive/typed
arguments (UUIDs, strings, dicts) — never a FastMCP ``AccessToken`` or other
request object. The (not-yet-built) MCP tools layer
is responsible for:

1. Verifying the caller's token and extracting identity claims.
2. Resolving the caller's ``sub`` to a board ``Agent.id`` (for every
   function below except ``register_agent``, which establishes that
   mapping in the first place).
3. Calling exactly one function here per tool invocation and mapping the
   three exception shapes in ``exceptions.py`` to ``ToolError`` messages.

This split keeps token verification out of the domain layer entirely (this
module never imports ``fastmcp``) and keeps every authorization/state-
machine/rate-limit/audit rule in one place so it cannot drift between
tools.

Identity threading (``actor_sub``)
-----------------------------------
Every function that can deny or mutate takes an explicit ``actor_sub``
keyword: the caller's VERIFIED raw token subject, sourced by the tools
layer from token claims — never re-derived here. It is threaded through
separately from any resolved ``*_agent_id`` because the two can fail
independently: a garbage/spoofed ``agent_id`` must still produce an
audit row attributable to the real ``actor_sub`` that presented it. Only
``register_agent`` accepts ``sub`` instead of a resolved ``agent_id``,
since establishing that mapping is exactly what it does.

Access model (v1, internal trust domain)
-----------------------------------------
- Board admission is the permission: an ``Agent`` row (created by
  ``register_agent``) is what lets a ``sub`` participate. No pairwise
  grants (DESIGN.md §4, §10 — the seam for one is
  ``_authorize_conversation_open``).
- Membership = visibility. An ``invited`` participant sees only minimal
  conversation metadata (no messages) until they call ``accept_invite``;
  an ``active`` participant sees full history; a ``left``/``declined``
  participant sees nothing further — identical to a non-member.
- Every conversation-scoped authorization failure raises the single
  uniform ``AccessDeniedError`` (see ``exceptions.py``) — identical message
  whether the conversation does not exist, the caller was never invited,
  is still ``invited`` and trying to read content or post, or
  left/declined. The audit trail distinguishes causes via the ``action``
  column even though the client-visible message never does.
- Conversation-open authorization routes through
  ``_authorize_conversation_open`` (whole-participant-set predicate) and
  invites through ``may_invite`` — the seams DESIGN.md §10 names for a
  future grants/consent layer.

Judgment calls made in this module (documented once, here, rather than
scattered as inline comments):

- **Expiry vs. history access**: lazy expiry (``expires_at`` in the past)
  flips an ``active`` conversation to ``expired`` on next touch and then
  treats it exactly like ``completed``/``canceled`` for *write* legality
  (``is_message_legal`` already rejects all message types outside
  ``active``). For *reads*, membership is still visibility: a participant
  who was ``active`` before expiry keeps read access to full history
  afterward — expiry ends the negotiation, it does not retroactively
  revoke a member's own record of it. This mirrors how ``completed`` and
  ``canceled`` conversations already remain readable by their members.
- **Unknown agent / type-not-accepted uniformity**: see
  ``exceptions.AccessDeniedError``'s docstring — folded into the uniform denial
  rather than given a leakier, more specific message.
- **Board-level ``Agent.status`` gating**: checked (uniform denial) on the
  *initiating* side of a write — starting a conversation, inviting, and
  posting all require the actor's own agent to be board-``active``, and
  ``invite``/``start_conversation`` require the same of every target. It
  is deliberately NOT re-checked on ``accept_invite``/``decline_invite``/
  ``leave``: those are a participant exiting or resolving their own
  already-granted membership, and a participant should always be able to
  do that even if ops suspends their agent mid-negotiation.

Audit contract
--------------
Every mutation AND every authorization/validation/rate-limit denial writes
an ``audit_log`` row, committed together with (or in place of) the
operation it describes. Denial actions are namespaced ``denied.*``:
``denied.not_member`` (no participant row at all), ``denied.wrong_state.
<status>`` (the participant OR the conversation itself is in the wrong
state for this operation — keeps each of a participant's "already
active"/"declined"/"left", and a conversation's "completed"/"canceled"
zombie-invite case, distinguishable in the trail even though the client
sees one uniform message), ``denied.unknown_agent``,
``denied.already_participant``, ``denied.bad_state`` (state-machine
violation), ``denied.bad_schema`` (payload validation),
``denied.rate_limited``, ``denied.ownership_unverified`` (an ownership
lookup failed — fail closed), ``denied.not_same_owner``/
``denied.no_owner_overlap`` (conversation-open admission failed for
``internal``/``asymmetric``), ``denied.owner_set_frozen`` (an invite would
expand a frozen owner set), ``denied.unknown_conversation_type`` (a
conversation row's ``type`` isn't in ``schemas.CONVERSATION_TYPES`` — a
migration/data-integrity gap, e.g. a legacy pre-rename row — distinct from
an actual ownership-boundary crossing), ``denied.boundary_crossing``/
``denied.wrong_sender_role`` (DESIGN.md §9 Axis 2's per-message checks), and
``denied.message_type_not_accepted`` (a recipient hasn't declared
``message_type`` in their own ``accepted_types`` — a capability gate, not a
trust boundary, so it applies universally, even to ``internal`` traffic
that boundary-crossing itself always allows).

    call it with owner_sub/owner_email taken from untrusted tool arguments.

    Idempotent: calling again with the same ``sub`` updates
    ``display_name``/``accepted_types``/``owner_email`` in place (unique on
    ``agents.sub``) rather than creating a duplicate row, and re-marks the
    agent ``active`` + refreshes ``bound_at``. ``owner_sub`` is the
    exception: it is frozen at first registration and never overwritten by
    a later call, even one presenting a different ``owner_sub`` — see the
    inline comment on the re-registration branch below: once
    ``add_task``'s ``may_assign`` started reading ``owner_sub`` as an
    admission-decision input, allowing a re-register to change it became a
    forgeable privilege-escalation path, not just an unmodeled edge case.

    Raises ``ValueError`` (not ``AccessDeniedError``) for malformed input --
    this is a data-validation failure, not an authorization decision (the
    caller has not claimed a resource yet). In validation order: empty ``sub``;
    empty or over-length (``schemas.MAX_DISPLAY_NAME_LENGTH``) ``display_name``;
    empty ``accepted_types``; over-count (``schemas.MAX_ACCEPTED_TYPES``)
    ``accepted_types``; or any entry over-length
    (``schemas.MAX_ACCEPTED_TYPE_LENGTH``) within ``accepted_types``. NOTE: an
    empty ``accepted_types`` previously raised ``UnknownConversationTypeError``
    with an empty "got unknown" list; it now raises this plain ``ValueError``
    instead (a deliberate breaking change to the ToolError shape for that one
    input -- there is no unknown value to usefully name for an empty list).
    An ``accepted_types`` containing a value outside ``MESSAGE_TYPES``
    instead raises ``UnknownConversationTypeError`` (exceptions.py) --
    specific and client-safe by design, unlike the cases above.

    This is a capability gate, not a trust boundary: whether a given

    about that specific running agent, unrelated to who sent it — so
    unlike ``_enforce_boundary_crossing``, this check is universal and
    applies even to ``internal`` same-owner traffic. Checked per-recipient
    (each of ``other_agents`` individually), not aggregated, since
    ``accepted_types`` is a per-agent fact, not a per-owner one.

    Takes already-resolved ``(agent_id, accepted_types)`` pairs rather than
    IDs to look up itself: every caller already has this data from a query
    that's fail-closed by construction (``_resolve_targets`` for
    ``start_conversation``; the ``participants JOIN agents`` in
    ``_check_boundary_crossing``, which can't miss a row given
    ``participants.agent_id``'s FK to ``agents.id``) — so there is no
    "agent ID present but its accepted_types row missing" case to guard
    against here, and no second round-trip to fetch what the caller
    already loaded.

    Sorted by agent ID before iterating so which recipient's denial gets
    audited is deterministic across runs, not an artifact of query-plan
    ordering, when more than one recipient would reject.

    Detail intentionally omits which recipient rejected it or their
    ``accepted_types``, mirroring ``denied.boundary_crossing``'s posture of
    not leaking a target's declared state to the sender.

    capability gate) for an existing conversation row — queries current

    requiring the caller to already know them.

    Single join query (participants + agents), not two separate
    round-trips: covers both ``_enforce_boundary_crossing``'s
    active-or-invited "other" set (queried unconditionally now, unlike the
    old asymmetric-and-unsafe-only gating this replaced — boundary
    crossing itself only needs an ownership lookup for the narrower case,
    but ``_enforce_message_type_accepted`` needs participant data on every
    send) and the capability gate's narrower active-only set below.

    The capability gate deliberately excludes ``invited`` (not yet
    accepted) participants, unlike the boundary-crossing set: an invite
    must not retroactively block existing ACTIVE members from sending
    message types they were already exchanging before the invite, just
    because the new invitee hasn't declared support for them yet. Once an
    invitee accepts and becomes ``active``, the very next send is checked
    against them normally — this only defers the check, it doesn't skip
    it forever. (Boundary-crossing's own "other" set has a different,
    already-established reason to include ``invited``: keeping it
    consistent with the owner-set-freeze snapshot taken at invite time --
    see that function's own docstring.)

    Accepted trade-off: this query now runs on every ``post_message`` call,
    including ones where the capability gate turns out to be a no-op (an
    ``open``/``internal`` conversation with every participant already
    accepting everything). Skipping it in that case would mean re-deriving
    "is this skippable" some other way -- which needs participant data

    transition the conversation to ``canceled`` unconditionally (each is

    The real implementation calls the platform's ownership lookup
    (not yet built; tracked as a follow-up). Tests fake
    this protocol directly. Every caller of ``get_agent_owners`` MUST fail
    closed on any exception — never treat a lookup error as "no match" vs.
    "match", since either silently loosens or tightens admission depending
    on what the caller assumes. ``agents.owner_sub``/``owner_email`` must
    NEVER be read directly for this decision (single-valued columns a
    shared agent's row cannot faithfully represent) — this protocol is
    the only sanctioned path.

    Implementations must not hold a live DB session open across their own
    ``get_agent_owners`` call: the eventual real implementation makes an
    external HTTP call to the ownership service, and holding a checked-out
    ``AsyncSession`` (and its connection-pool slot) for the duration of
    that round trip risks pool exhaustion under concurrency
    (``db.py``'s ``pool_size``/``max_overflow`` are small). Construct a
    future HTTP-backed implementation independently of any request's
    session, not inside the ``async with get_session_factory()()`` block
    that owns it — unlike the interim ``AgentTableOwnershipClient`` below,
    which is a same-transaction DB read and has no such constraint.

    Wraps the existing ``agents.owner_sub`` column as a single-element
    owner set; ``is_shared`` is always ``False`` since no shared-agent
    concept exists in this schema yet. This is exactly correct for every
    agent registered today: two agents bound to the same ``owner_sub``
    (e.g. two agents belonging to one person) intersect via ``may_assign``
    precisely as they should, and unrelated agents correctly do not. Swap
    this for a real platform-backed client the moment shared agents exist
    — the ``OwnershipClient`` protocol is the seam, not this class.

    Safe to use as an authorization input specifically because
    ``register_agent`` freezes ``owner_sub`` at first registration and
    never overwrites it on re-registration (see that function) — reading
    it here would otherwise let a caller forge a victim's ``owner_sub``
