"""add tasks table

Revision ID: 6d2a8e63e469
Revises: 18f2d7735523
Create Date: 2026-08-12 00:09:33.389567

NOTE on in-place amendment (mirrors migrations/versions/18f2d7735523's own
note): this revision has been authored and iterated on entirely within
this single unmerged PR (agent-comms-mcp PR #9) — it does not
exist on `main`, and it has never been applied to any persistent or shared
database. CI runs `alembic upgrade head` against a fresh, ephemeral
Postgres service container on every run; local review testing always ran
full `downgrade base` -> `upgrade head` cycles against the latest file
content. In-place amendment during code review is therefore safe — there
is no environment where this revision is recorded as already-applied in a
state older than the one below. Once this PR merges, treat this file as
frozen: any further schema change requires a NEW Alembic revision, never
an edit to this one.

Every DROP in downgrade() below is guarded (if_exists, or raw `DROP ...
IF EXISTS` SQL for drop_constraint()/drop_table(), neither of which has an
if_exists kwarg) so re-running downgrade against a partially-applied state
never aborts — belt-and-suspenders per Argus round 3/4's request, on top
of the in-place-amendment rationale above. The CREATEs in upgrade() are
guarded for indexes (if_not_exists) and the one column add (raw `ADD
COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` SQL), but NOT for `create_table("tasks", ...)` or the
two FK/CHECK constraint adds: Postgres has no `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
equivalent that also lets Alembic manage the table via `op.create_table`,
and no `ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS` syntax at all — matching the same
non-idempotent constraint-add precedent already set by
ef8394b37c8d/18f2d7735523. In practice this asymmetry is harmless here:
upgrade() only ever needs to re-run from a clean base per the in-place-
amendment rationale above (there is no partially-upgraded state to resume
into), so the guarding effort went into downgrade(), where a partial state
is the exact case this file's own iterative dev/review cycle exercises.
