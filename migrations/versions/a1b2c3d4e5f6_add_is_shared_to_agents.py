"""add is_shared to agents

Revision ID: a1b2c3d4e5f6
Revises: 2cc5185360c7

DEPLOYMENT: no stop-then-start needed -- this is a plain additive, backward-
compatible column with a ``server_default``, and ``entrypoint.sh`` already
runs ``alembic upgrade head`` before ``agent-comms-mcp`` starts serving,
atomically, on every container startup. A normal rolling deploy is safe:
each new container migrates-then-serves before taking traffic, and an
old container still running (with code that never references
``is_shared``) tolerates the column's presence fine. The only real
ordering constraint is the one ``entrypoint.sh`` already enforces
per-container: migrate before serve, not a cluster-wide stop-then-start.

Rollback: dropping the column is safe. ``server_default=false`` means every
existing row already has a concrete, non-null value, so a downgrade loses
no data other than the flag itself (which no pre-existing agent could have
set anyway, since the column didn't exist for it to write to).
